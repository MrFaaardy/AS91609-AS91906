# Physics Simulator Prototype
This is my prototype program for my DTP301 project.

## Features
- Has a menu to navigate through different game environments.
- Only has 1 existing environment view being a Gravity Simulation.
- The environment contains a closed box to spawn ball objects which includes a sidebar to change the ball's properties such as Mass/Size and Elasticity (how bouncy the ball is)
